### 🔧 Tips to Make it Even Better

- Replace `https://via.placeholder.com/...` with actual GitHub image links.
- Add animated GIFs or short Loom videos for interactive demos.
- Include badges for individual projects (e.g., `Live Demo`, `Built With React`).
- If your portfolio is deployed (e.g., on Vercel), link each screenshot to the live demo.

Let me know if you want me to generate badges, GIF previews, or a collapsible layout too!
